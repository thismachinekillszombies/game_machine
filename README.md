# Game Machine

Game Machine is a sprite based 2D game development tool that wraps PyGame. It
is part of This Machine Kills Zombies, a project developing coding tutorials
aimed at Keystage 3/4 pupils (age 11 - 14).

Game Machine is intended to create a very low learning barrier to getting
working games. It is not intened as a replacement for PyGame.

Game Machine is currently very much in development, and is likely to undergo
significant changes to how it works. There is currently no public documentation
or API. It is not currently recommended to be
used other than by those involved in the This Machine Kills Zombies Project.

The stable release will be 1.0 and above, and an API will be published with
the stable release.
