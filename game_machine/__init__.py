Game Machine
------------

Game Machine is a wrapper for pygame, intended to make an extremely shallow
learning curve for getting a decently engaging game working. It is intended to
be an educational tool for complete programming novices, or as a bridge from
Scratch to Python.

It was developed as part of the This Machine Kills Zombies project, which
introduces Python programming on the Raspberry Pi. It should, however, be
completely portable to other platforms and projects.

Just to restate: Game Machine is **not** intended to be a replacement for, or
improvement on pygame.
